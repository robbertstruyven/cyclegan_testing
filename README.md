# Cyclegan Testing
CycleGAN In Keras and Tensorflow 2.0

- **Based on "Transforming the World Into Paintings with CycleGAN":** [article 1](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-beauty-of-cyclegan-c51c153493b8) and [article2](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/transforming-the-world-into-paintings-with-cyclegan-6748c0b85632).
- [**Original CycleGAN paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf)

**Cyclegan implemented:** [cyclegan.ipynb](https://github.com/robbertstruyven/cyclegan_testing/blob/master/cyclegan.ipynb)

To improve: 
- **Imagenet Classification:** [classification.ipynb](https://github.com/robbertstruyven/cyclegan_testing/blob/master/classification_resnet.ipynb)
  - Apply Imagenet Trained Model on Monet Paintings = will fail
  - Apply Imagenet Trained Model on Monet Paintings transformed to real life domain = succes?
- **MNIST Classification:** [??.ipynb](...)
  - Apply MNIST Trained Model on SVHN* Images = will fail
  - Apply MNIST Trained Model on SVHN* Images transformed to MNIST domain = succes?
- **Segmentation:** [??.ipynb](...)
  - ..
  
**NB:** SVHN* = Street View House Numbers Dataset
